## BED file format

BED stands for browser extensible data and is a way of adding feature tracks to the genome data. Technically it is a tab-delimited text file that defines a feature track. There could be 
multiple feature tracks in one region one below another. There are also thickRegions in the features specified in the BED data. Only 3 fields are mandatory and the rest 9 out of 12 are optional
There can be additional custom defined fields in the compressed version of BED ( bigbed ) which is known as autoSQL.
