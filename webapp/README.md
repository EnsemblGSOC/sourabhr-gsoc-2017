# bigwig-parser
A javascript parser for BigWig and BigBed genome annotation files. <img src='https://travis-ci.org/sourabh2k15/bigwig-parser.svg?branch=master' />


TODO:
1) Add explanation of the file structures and parsing procedure. 
2) Add jasmine tests. 

Clone the repo, load it in your browser. Paste in a bb file url or choose a file from filepicker. Click fetch to load the file. 
Click "this" to query with this script. 
Click "dalliance" to see how it performs with the dalliance parser.

Timing stats are shown in side by side divs.
For BigWig files data is drawn onto a canvas, for BigBed you could open up the console to see the values.
