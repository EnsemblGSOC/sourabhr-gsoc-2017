# sourabhr-gsoc-2017
This repository hosts the final work product submission report, code and demo for GSOC 2017 final evaluation. I worked on Genoverse genome browser under my mentor, Steve Trevanion's guidance. I worked on enabling support for BigWig, BigBed , compressed VCF , Wiggle and BED file formats in Genoverse.
